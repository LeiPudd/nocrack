# NoCrack  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rchatterjee/nocrack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rchatterjee/nocrack)
A new generation password manager that __resist offline brute-force attack__. 
See [my project page](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rahul/projects/NoCrack.html) for more details.

## New Changes
1. The cleaned code is in `newcode/` directory. The other folders will removed
   eventually, and the code in `newcode/` will become the primary. Right now I
   am testing and making changes. The current version in master is stable, and
   working. (Please open [Issues](https://github.com/rchatterjee/nocrack/issues)
   if you still find bugs.)

### Please go to [`newcode/`](./newcode) for current code.
